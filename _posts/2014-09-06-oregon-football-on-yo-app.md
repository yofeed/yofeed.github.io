If you're an Oregon Duck superfan and also happen to use [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/), then this should make you happy. I recently wrote a script that will Yo whenever the Oregon Ducks football team scores. All you have to is add OREGONFOOTBALL on Yo and the internet takes care of the rest.

If you're watching the game and don't want to get Yo'd or the Ducks are scoring every minute (which isn't uncommon), you can block OREGONFOOTBALL and you'll stop getting Yo's.
